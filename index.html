        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Johanna R. Villahermosa. I wanted to share my newfound interest for cooking with this blog website. I've only cooked pretty simple stuff that don't take too long to cook so recipes would be fairly simple to follow. I'll also be sharing the stories behind my recipes. One of the best thing I've discovered about cooking is how food is a big part of our lives and each of these recipes have backstories that never fail to warm my heart. So, without futher ado, I hope you guys enjoy my blog website.</p>

                    <h3>Pork Tonkatsu</h3>
                    <p>Im gonna start this one off with what sparked my urge to cook in the first place. I was never one to actually commit to trying new and unfamiliar stuff but, if it meant that I do it for someone else, it's pretty much a no-brainer for me to at least try.<br></p>
                    <p><br>This one I made as part of a bento box that I assembled for me and my partner's 2nd monthsary. He's always brought me food so I wouldn't go hungry and he's been contemplating buying a proper lunch box to bring so he wouldn't have to put our food in containers for fondant (his mom bakes a lot). <br></p>
                    <p><br>Good thing he kept putting off buying one since it meant I get to do it for him. So, I went ahead and bought a bento box. It even came with an insulated bag so the food would remain warm. I bought it off tiktok shop here's the <a href="https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSjSBVLUc/">link</a> if y'all are interested. <br></p>
                    <p><br>I then thought to myself that "I should cook for him too while I'm at it." I figured I should go the distance and make us both lunch so I wouldn't just be giving him an empty box, I'd also be feeding him. Anyway, here's the recipe.<br></p>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pork loin chops (you can buy these already cut in the supermarket)</li>
                        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>Eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
                        <li>Salt and pepper for seasoning (you can add more this was all I had)</li>
                        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
                        <li>Tonkatsu sauce (I'm gonna be showing how I made it homemade. You may modify it since I only used what I had in the fridge at that moment)</li>
                        <li>Shredded cabbage (They typically serve the tonkatsu with this as a palate cleanser but it's optional)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Season the pork chops with salt and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Coat each pork chop first in flour, then dip it into the beaten eggs, and finally coat it in panko breadcrumbs.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the pork chops until golden brown and cooked through, about 4-5 minutes per side. Make sure the oil is deep enough to submerge the chops halfway.</li>
                        <li>Remove the pork chops from the oil and place them on a wire rack to rest. (I made a substitute wirerack with chopsticks propped on a bowl so the chops are at least suspended lol)</li>
                        <li>Serve the tonkatsu with shredded cabbage and a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>How I made tonkatsu sauce:</h3>
                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ketchup</li>
                        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                        <li>Sugar</li>
                        <li>Garlic, chopped into very small bits</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine 2 to 1 ratio of ketchup and soy sauce.</li>
                        <li>Add sugar to taste depending on how sweet you want your sauce to be. Mix and make sure to dissolve the sugar in the ketchup and soy sauce mixture</li>
                        <li>Finally, add garic to taste too. Let the flavors marinate for probably 10 minutes before giving it a final taste to adjust the flavors of the ingridients. You may adjust it to however you'd like.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Garlic Green Beans</h3>
                    <p>This is a pretty simple recipe, This was meant to be a side dish for the tonkatsu. I honestly just followed a tiktok video to make this side dish since it only needed 5 ingridients with which I have(here's the <a href="https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSjSD8VJq/">link</a>) so, here you go: <br></p>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Green Beans (I used baguio beans), chopped into bite size pieces</li>
                        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                        <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
                        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
                        <li>Garlic, chopped</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat up some oil in the pan to then put the green beans. Just toss it around until it browns a little bit.</li>
                        <li>Toss in your garlic, add some soy sauce and oyter sauce, and mix until their incorporated.</li>
                        <li>Serve with main dishes or you could just eat and make some as is as a snack.</li>
                        <p><br>Later I'll be showing you guys how i assembled the bento box after I finish with the fried rice recipe. *wink wink*<br><br></p>

                    <h3>Fried Rice</h3>
                    <p>Pretty simple fried rice recipe I have for you here. Backstory for this one though, I was craving something to eat one night so, I went downstairs to make a midnight snack for myself. Midnight snack ended up being a midnight meal since I wasn't completely aware of how hungry I really was. I ended up gathering all the ingridients I could to make fried rice.<br></p>
                    <p><br>For the ulam, There was only galunggong in the refrigerator. I wanted to just reheat it but thought of how tedious it would be to eat with bones so, as an experiment, I decided to debone it and toss it in with the fried rice. Girl math guys, I basically saved effort by just completely eliminating the process of deboning WHILE eating and instead did it BEFORE and tossed the ulam in with the rice. Nothing short of genius I'd say. So, here you go.<br></p>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cooked Rice</li>
                        <li>Knorr Liquid Seasoning</li>
                        <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
                        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
                        <li>Garlic, chopped</li>
                        <li>Eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>Protein, which in my case, galunggong , deboned and shredded</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat up some oil in the pan to cook the garlic.</li>
                        <li>Before the garlic is cooked through add the shredded fish/protein to cook it with the garlic</li>
                        <li>After the garlic is cooked, put them to the side to cook the egg slightly. Just enough that it's still somewhat fluffy.</li>
                        <li>Add the rice and season to taste with the liquid seasoning, salt, pepper, and the oyster sauce. Combine everything until everything is seasoned well</li>
                        <li>Serve it in a bowl so bawas hugasin. And that's it</li>

                    <h3>Bento Box Assembly</h3>
                    <p>Quick backstory, day came that I'm supposed to meet up with my partner to give him what I cooked. Haven't seen him for probably a few days so I was excited to finally give him my monthsary present albeit, I was slightly anxious that he might not like it.<br></p>
                    <p><br>Luckily he liked it a lot so waking up at an ungodly early hour in the morning was well worth it. Anyway this isn't going to be a recipe but more like a guide on how to assemble a bento box. Here you go.<br></p>

                        <li>This is completely optional but I mapped out how I wanted the bento to look like by drawing it out. Here's an example</li>
